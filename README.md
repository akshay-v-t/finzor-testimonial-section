# Finzor Carousel Project

## Overview
The Finzor Carousel Project is an interactive and visually engaging carousel designed to showcase items with a distinctive scrolling animation. Each item alternates in movement, with one item always centered and marked as active, creating a unique viewing experience.

## Features
- **Automatic Scroll**: Items scroll horizontally, providing continuous movement.
- **Alternate Animation**: Items animate by moving up and down in alternating patterns, adding dynamic visual interest.
- **Hover Pause**: Carousel pauses on mouse hover, resuming on mouse leave.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimized mobile and desktop experience.
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup for creating the structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling, including animations and transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for controlling scrolling, centering, and dynamic animations.

## Installation
Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred editor:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
cd finzor-carousel
```

## Usage
1. **Initialize**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the carousel.
2. **Customization**: Modify `carousel-item` content in `index.html` to add items, and adjust animation speeds or directions in the `script.js` file.
3. **Responsive Adjustments**: For mobile customizations, modify the `@media` query section in `style.css`.

## Code Highlights
- **Dynamic Cloning**: Items are cloned in JavaScript to create a seamless, infinite scroll.
- **CSS Animations**: Up-and-down motion for each item achieved through keyframe animations in CSS.
- **Transform Transitions**: Smooth transformations maintain a visually fluid experience.
